Masked repetition priming is believed to reflect lexical access in visual word recognition. It is reportedly word-specific and insensitive to frequency, although the latter claim is disputed. We hypothesize that past disparate findings are due to lack of statistical power. Consequently, we ran two large masked priming experiments online. The first established the feasibility of such experiments, revealing word-specific repetition effects for both high and low frequency words. The interaction between repetition and frequency was small and not statistically significant. The second study was pre-registered to have high power for detecting a 15ms interaction effect. The results again showed masked repetition priming effects, now with a 12ms interaction being statistically detected. We conclude that the repetition effect in masked repetition priming is moderately modulated by frequency. Addionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of conducting masked priming experiments online, allowing the detection of smaller effects that have historically eluded lab-based experiments.
