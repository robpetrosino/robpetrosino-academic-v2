Cartography assumes that syntactic structures are more complex than the usual functional phrases; for example, CP is arguably made up of several projections, each of which is assigned specific scope-discourse features (such as focus and topic; Rizzi 1997). This paper contributes to the debate raging over whether all cartographic projections are always present. By looking at cross-clausal A-binding conditions in Italian, I show that an anaphor can be bound across clauses only when at the outmost phasal edge. This ultimately provides evidence that the full cartographic CP domain may not always be projected.
