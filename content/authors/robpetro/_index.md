# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
#bio: My research program aims to identify the mechanisms underlying the processing of words as a way to understand how the smaller abstract units therein – that is, phonemes and morphemes – are organized in the mind. To this end, I use both behavioral measures (primarily, lexical decision tasks, and visual and auditory masked priming) and electrophysiological measures (specifically, EEG).

interests:
- Phonological theory & processing
- Morphological theory & processing
- Computational linguistics and NLP

I am post-doctoral researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). 

At the broadest level, my research program seeks to explore the nature of the mental representations that form the atoms of language and of the computations that compose those atoms into larger structures. I explore these two questions at the _sub-word level_ – i.e., within the domains of phonology and morphology – and, crucially, by leveraging evidence from real-time word processing using both behavioral measures (primarily, lexical decision tasks, including both visual and auditory masked priming) and electrophysiological measures (in particular, moderate- and high-density EEG). My specific current theoretical interests can be summarized in two separate questions:

1. [**How rich are the phonological and morphological representations stored in the mental lexicon?**]({{< relref "/project/richness/index.md" >}})
2. [**What is the representational and computational relationship between morphological alternants?**]({{< relref "/project/alternations/index.md" >}})

Over the last few years, I have also developed a deep understanding of current NLP/NLU systems, with the ultimate goal of contributing to clarifying the interaction between human language and modern AI models, and ultimately bridging the gap between linguistic theory, cognitive psychology, and computer science. 

I am also a freelance linguist consultant for Pole To Win UK Intl. My main duties are: linguistic annotation, phonemic transcription, text-to-speech (TTS), sound quality check, audio analysis, translation, and proofreading.
