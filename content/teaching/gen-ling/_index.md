## Is language innate?

**Behavioralists** believe that language acquisition results from
direct association between *stimulus* and *response* (Skinner 1957). As
a consequence, acquiring a language means memorizing all possible
sentences in a given language. _However_

1. Our memory capacities would need to be powerful enough to do that ? and we are yet far from understanding it wholly. 
2. On top of that, consider the following sentences and complete accordingly, by using your intuition: 

- The man is tall. $\rightarrow$ Is the man tall? 
- The man kisses the girl. $\rightarrow$ ___________
- The man kissed the girl $\rightarrow$ ___________
- The man has kissed the girl. $\rightarrow$ ___________
- The man who runs has kissed the girl. $\rightarrow$ ___________

What I am getting at? Assuming that language acquisition occurs through
memorization is obviously wrong - what would (a-e) have been, if that
assumption was correct?\
*Your answer*:

. **Generativists** believe that language must have (some degree of)
innateness: we are factually born with specific abilities, which make us
able to acquire our native language when we were kids. This occurs: .
*effortlessly* --- children typically manage to master their native
language by the age of 5. Strikingly, when they speak, they make very
few errors. .̱ in spite of the so-called poverty of stimulus: children
just pick a language, although the input is typically: . *noisy* ---
when we speak, we provide with a signal full of errors, interruptions,
breaks .̱ *limited* --- if we reckon the great amount of possibilities to
mean the same thing with different words; on top of that, children do
not seem to rely on *negative evidence* (i.e., direct teaching of what
is grammatically wrong) at all.

. The bullets above are also known as the **logic problem of language
acquisition**, already recognized by Plato (V-IV BC).

. The immediate consequence is that we must be endowed with a
***somewhat innate* faculty of language**, which allows children to
manipulate the stimulus and acquire a language from it.

## A trio of abilities

. **Displaced reference**, the ability of talking about something afar
from 'here and now'.

> For example, I can tell you about my family in Italy (3,600+ miles
> away: *spatial distance*) or about my recent vacation in Germany (a
> couple of weeks ago: *temporal distance*); if I were an astronaut
> traveling the cosmos, I could have talked about my last trip to
> Kepler-186f (490 light years: *spatio-temporal distance*).

. **Discreteness**, the ability of using a fixed inventory of 'building
blocks' which can be combined to form bigger units.

. **Recursion**, the ability of applying whatever operation over and
over: . \[John is sad\] .̱ \[Dorothy thinks that \[John is sad\]\] .̧
\[Toto suspects that \[Dorothy thinks that \[John is sad\]\]\] .̣ \[Lucy
wonders whether \[Toto suspects that \[Dorothy thinks that \[John is
sad\]\]\]\]\

# Grammars

## Generative grammar

. **Open-endedness**. We are able to make use a limited set of
linguistic rules to mean the same thing in a potentially infinite number
of ways.

. **Creativity**. Speakers can therefore produce and understand any
number of messages that have *never been expressed before*, also thanks
to recursion. . Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. (Chomsky, 1957) .̱
Pink elephants were dancing on TV when the astronaut called home to say
that he got safely to Mars. (Roberto, 2017) .̧ I'm so hungry that I could
*devour* you in one bite! (Sophia, $\sim$`<!-- -->`{=html}3 yy.o.o.,
2009)

. **Tacit knowledge**. We all know how to speak our native languages
without being taught --- we *just* know it.

### Activity 1: Systematic and accidental gaps

*Look at the following pseudo-words; following your intuition, which of
them are possible words in English? Check the corresponding box.*

1.  mbood(10,10)

2.  frall(10,10)

3.  coofp(10,10)

4.  ktleem(10,10)

5.  flube (10,10)

6.  sglop (10,10)

7.  blick (10,10)

8.  bnick (10,10)

9.  strick(10,10)

. Halle (1973): . Unchecked words are examples of *systematic gaps* ---
they do not exist in a language due to language-specific constraints (at
the phonological, morphological, syntactic or semantic level). .̱ Checked
words are *accidental gaps* --- they do not exist in some language, but
which would be permitted by the grammatical rules of the language.

### Activity 2: *Wanna*-contraction

*Consider the following sentence:*

. Nathan Petrelli is a politician I want to succeed.

This sentence has two meanings - describe them:

1.  
2.  

. Nathan Petrelli is a politician I wanna succeed.

*Your answer:*

. []{#1 label="1"} . The student who cheated on the exam is the one I
want to fail. .̱The student who cheated on the exam is the one I wanna
fail.

. []{#2 label="2"} . Fedora Saura is a racehorse I want to win. .̱ Fedora
Saura is a racehorse I wanna win.

. []{#3 label="3"} . The Braeburn is a variety of apple I want to grow
here. .̱ The Braeburn is a variety of apple I wanna grow here.

*Do the sentences in [\[1\]](#1){reference-type="ref" reference="1"}a,
[\[2\]](#2){reference-type="ref" reference="2"}a,
[\[3\]](#3){reference-type="ref" reference="3"}a have one possible
meaning, or two?\

        python with two heads.

## Prescriptive vs descriptive grammars

. **Prescriptive grammar** is the set of rules governing how (group of)
people think language *should* be used. In a prescriptive grammar there
is right and wrong language. Some examples of prescriptive rules: . .̱ .̧

. **Descriptive grammar** is the set of rules governing what people *do
and can* actually say. It describes how a language actually works. Some
examples of descriptive rules: . .̱ .̧

. Generative linguists observe speakers' linguistic *performance*, in
order to draw conclusions about their linguistic *competence*.
Therefore, they are mainly interested in ().

. The final aim of generativist linguists is to build up **generative
grammars**: . *specific* enough to be able to account for all phenomena
detectable in that language .̱ *powerful* enough to be able to adopted
for other languages as well.

We will see that this is tricky, and sometimes very challenging from
both a theoretical and empirical point of view.

. Some language myths. . ~~There are 5 vowels in English.~~ .̱ ~~Educated
people speak more grammatically than uneducated people.~~ .̧ ~~Reading
and writing are an essential part of language.~~ .̣ ~~Linguists speak
lots of languages.~~ . ~~The languages of "primitive" societies are
simpler than languages like English and French.~~ .̑ ~~Animals and people
can both use language.~~ .̑ ~~Intelligence is a major factor in a child's
ability to acquire a language.~~ .̑ ~~As a language passes from one
generation to another it gets corrupted.~~ .̑ ~~Speakers of different
languages think differently.~~ .̑ ~~Linguists correct/criticize how
people talk.~~

## Science vs pseudo-science

. engl. *science* \< lat. *scientı̆a* \< lat. *scı̆o* 'I know'\
Originally referred to any branch of human knowledge --- i.e.,
mathematics as well as philosophy or literature. Only starting from mid
of XIX century, the term has gained the current meaning.

. Practice of science always involves a *rigorous method*.

::: center
:::

. Scientific hypotheses should be explicit enough that they make precise
predictions that are testable. . Confirmations are never definitive
proof of a theory. .̱ Unattended predicted observations may count towards
falsification of a theory; however, apparent counterevidence may await a
reanalysis.

## Pseudo-linguistics

. Language is a topic of endless fascination. As a consequence, any
people seek to fascinate without bothering to find out if what they are
saying about language is scientifically valid. .The author is not
engaged with the community of linguistics scholars. .̱ She conflates
central concepts that are actually different. .̧ She fails to engage with
complex linguistic data.

. Some examples: . Australian speech patterns determined by drunk
forefathers. .̱ Language change is predictable from humidity, altitude,
etc.

. Bigger, more dangerous problem: depiction of science in the media.

### Activity 4: Talk shop

*Read each of the following statements and discuss them. What is your
sentiment about them? Remember that there is no correct answer.*

1.  The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that language and environment in
    which it is spoken are tightly connected, in such a way that they
    influence each other. There are two possible interpretations of such
    statement. A weak view argues that language has an effect on how we
    interpret the world; a stronger view holds that language defines and
    constrains our thoughts.

    1.  Languages where gender agreement is marked, may reflect
        socio-political supremacy of a gender class (e.g., men) over the
        other one (e.g., women).

2.  Some dialects are inferior to others.

3.  Esperanto is a constructed international auxiliary language
    (*auxlang*) invented in the late 1800s, with the aim of creating an
    easy-to-learn and politically neutral language that would transcend
    nationality and foster international cooperation.

# Recap

. Until 1950s, language acquisition has been traditionally considered to
an ability merely resulting from the mere behavioral response to a
specific external stimulus. Noam Chomsky argued against such assumption
and pointed out: . child performance typically reaches its peak at age
of 5, without active teaching being really effective (***tacit
knowledge***) and without a transparent input to refer to (***poverty of
stimulus***); .̱ learning by memorization is empirically impossible,
because we would need an incredible amount of memory to store all
possible linguistic structures (***open-ended creativity***). .̧
therefore, we must have an innate, universal set of rules for organizing
language --- *Universal Grammar (UG)*.

. Human language complexity is mainly due to three cognitive abilities:
***displaced reference, discreteness, recursion***.

. As such, linguists are not interested in imposing rules, rather in
describing and explaining structures *unconsciously* used by speakers;
the term "unconsciously" refers to the fact that speakers do not
explicitly know why, but they do know possible and impossible structures
in a given language (*grammaticality*).

. People interested in language should be wary of *pseudo-linguistics*.
Linguistics, as all other sciences, must be pursued rigorously, in
compliance with the Galilean scientific method.
